                    <h1>Expedia RewardTrax Demo and Website</h1>

                    <h4 id="1">What is the Exepdia RewardTrax Demo and Website?</h4>
                    <p>On this project we had the oppurtunity to land one of our biggest cliients ever Expedia. I was the assigned designer for building and designing the demo for the sales team and then once we won the contract I was also the assigned designer for their actual website.</p>
                    <p> In this case study, I will be sharing my process and rationale behind some of my decisions that I made designing for Expedia and to explore the process I took on working on such a large impactful project.</p>
                    <h4 id="2">The Demo</h4>
                    <p>After we got far enough down the Sale's funnel the sales team reached out to me to build a functioning demo for Exepdia. When we do a demo it's essentially a striped down version of how an actual client site would work and look like.</p>

                    <h4 id="3">Post Sale</h4>
                    <p>After we sold the program to Expedia, the Account Manager got me and our software dev team on the same page, for this program there wasn't a lot of back end custom work.</p>
                    <h4 id="4">Goals</h4>
                    <p>Here are some of the goals we had established for this program, due to how important they are as a client:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Faster turnaround, we usually launch in 8 weeks, for this we had a 6 week timeline</li>
                        <li>Less client edits</li>
                        <li>One more goal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 id="5">Process:</h4>
                    <p>I was brought ontoo design both the demo and final site. Here I will outline my process for working on this client's site</p>
                    <img src="images/ISIWeb/ISI_Colors.jpg" alt="">
                    <h5>Branding</h5>
                    <p>The first thing I did was get more familiar with Expedia's branding, so I could get a better understanding of how I will use their colors and typeface accross the site.</p>
                    <h5>Client's input</h5>
                    <p>I spoke with the account manager and client on a call discussing overall look and feel they wanted, asked questions regarding branding and how they'd want the images displayed across the site.</p>
                    <h5>Design</h5>
                    <p>From here I begin to design the website with all the info I got from the client.</p>
                    <h4 id="11">FINAL DESIGNS</h4>
                    <p>Here's a few pages I had made for the client, including a fully custom shopping page.</p>
                    <h4 id="12">RESULTS</h4>
                    <p>Overall the project was a large success we met all of our goals and our client's were pleased. This was the largest account I had ever worked on for the company and I even introduced some things to make the process better in the future.</p>
